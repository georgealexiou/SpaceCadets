# SCChallengeEmail

Have a look at the Web page at https://www.ecs.soton.ac.uk/people/dem. This is a departmental information page which gives all sorts of information
about a student or member of staff. The Web address is constructed from a departmental email id (in this case dem). If I have someone else's email id, I
can look up their name from one of these Web pages. Try it with your own email id. In fact, the name used to start at the 12th character of the 6th line
of the HTML data returned by the Web server. It finishes when a '<' character appears. (Choose 'View Source' from your Web browser to check where it
is now.)
Write a program which converts an email id into a name by
 1. Constructing a BufferedReader object so that can read an email id from System.in (you will need some intermediate objects to help you here. Look it up!)
 2. Constructing the full Web page address by string concatenation
 3. Constructing a URL object from the Web address
 4. Constructing a BufferedReader object that can read from the URL (you will need some intermediate objects to help you here. Look in the book!)
 5. Ignoring the first lines of input from the Web page and saving the one which contains the name (Hint: <... property="name">)
 6. Use the indexOf() and substring() methods to find and extract the name from the line
7. Print out the result
